# My personal `.hgrc`

This is the `~/.hgrc` file I use at work, kept in version control just for my
own sake.


## Installing

    $ # assuming `pwd` is the directory you want to keep the project in
    $ git clone https://github.com/danpassaro/hgrc
    $ ln -s hgrc/hgrc ~/.hgrc

## Using git and github to version your hgrc?

Yep :D I am not a particularly big fan of hg *or* Bitbucket.
